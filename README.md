## Requirements
* Rails 5.2.3
* PostgresSQL
* Mailcatcher - Dev Only

If you need help setting up a Ruby development environment, check out this [guide](https://mattbrictson.com/rails-osx-setup-guide)

## Setting Up and Testing
Run the following command in CS370 directory:
```
$ bundle install --without production
```
This will download any files along with gems in order to make the app run properly.

```
$ rails db:reset
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails server
```
This will launch the server.
* You may need to set up admin credential locally first in order to access admin page.
Do the following:
```
$ rails c
````
This opens the Rails development enviroment. For example:
```
Running via Spring preloader in process 89006
Loading development environment (Rails 5.2.3)
2.5.3 :001 > 
```
Now, you will have to initialize an Admin object by the following line:
```
> Admin.create(:password => "whatever_password_you_want", :current_semester => "Spring2019", :statistics_semester => "Spring2019")
```
Lastly, in order to view coverage and run tests. Do:
```
$ cucumber
```
and/or
```
$ rspec
```

In development email are caught by local smtp server, mailcatcher. If you want to view email please do the following OUTSIDE of the project. There will be dependicy issues if you try to include mailcatcher in gem file

```
$ gem install mailcatcher
$ mailcatcher
```

## Deployment
The first thing you want to do is check if you have git.
```
$ git --version
```
If you do not have git, install it following this [guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/).

The next step you want to take is create a heroku account if you dont already have it.
To deploy the application to heroku start first by creating a [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) account.
When you have an account follow this [heroku guide deployment guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).
And thats how you deploy to heroku using git.

After the application is up and running in heroku, create an admin to set the semester and begin using the application.
To create an admin, run the following in the git repository linked to heroku.
```
$ heroku run rails c
```
This will create a ruby console for the heroku app. Then simply as indicated above to create an admin.
```
> Admin.create(:password => "whatever_password_you_want", :current_semester => "Spring2019", :statistics_semester => "Spring2019")
```
This will create an admin for the deployed application. Now type exit to get out of the rails console.
```
> exit
```
There you have it, you can now log in as admin and set the semester, and courses. and the app is ready for use.

## Future Possible Features

* Student Selection Priority and Filtering: As a tutor, so that you can match with students in need of help, you should see a list of students ranked by priority. For instance, those CS scholar and students who have not been selected for a while.

* Manual Filtering: As a tutor, when you are browsing between students, you can manually filter students based on their courses or topics of interest.

* Live OCF Link: After the admin successfully registers with the OCF center with a username and password of his choice, he may have a live working link (website_name.berkeley.edu) after transferring the application files through SSH.
